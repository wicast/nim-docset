### Name alias 
The entry types of docset is [limited](https://kapeli.com/docsets#supportedentrytypes),so I have to choose other name for Nim's unique concept like `let`,`iterator`

|  nim   | docset |
|--------|--------|
|let     |Value   |
|converter|Modifier|
|iterator|Provider|
|template|Shortcut|

Forgive my poor english :( ,I can't figure out another more accurate names.If you have batter ideas,open a new issue,plz.

#### TODO
- [ ] Manual and Api documation can't distinct by just using css selector.
- [ ] Batter Entry names.
